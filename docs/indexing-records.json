With Xcode autocomplete helping us along?  Turns out you can! Just add this Package to your project and start coding. If you want a bit of the backstory and a few more details then read on. If you haven’t yet read Measurement in Swift: Simplified , it’s only 2 minutes and, as an earlier work, sets the stage for improvements and updates that follow herein. Apparently, I have a character flaw that makes it difficult to be satisfied with less than an elegant solution. One that not only enables me to write clearly and succinctly but also scales from a specific to a more general solution. Given the ease of supporting simple Measurements (as previously explained) I really wanted to extend this pattern to Compound Unit Measurements or at least to the more common Ratio. Every time I started in on creating a collection of new Unit combinations I became dissatisfied with the repetitiveness in creating new ones. It wasn’t really a lot of code but enough to clutter the call site and aggravate me enough to search for a solution. So after more thought and more than a bit of aggravated wrangling with generics, I worked it out; it turns out you can, with the smallest additions do this. Of course, no sooner than I worked out my own solution, I found Rate.swift at a cleaner one. So I used it, with only some small extensions following the pattern I used for the standard Measurements. The trick is to create a generic struct using the standard Measurement Unit. Add in methods for addition, subtraction, and multiplication along with the appropriately overloaded operators and you are off to the races.  And along with typealias and the judicious, if not clever, use of callAsFunction to enable the 2(.hours)  syntax we get to use all of the Foundation Measurement Units out-of-the-box.  There really isn’t much more than that. It’s pretty much an rinse-and-repeat for a few more data types. Refer to the GitHub project for the full source and a package you can include in your projects. I have learned a lot from the many, many contributors out there. To them, I say “Thank you”. For you, the reader, I look forward to your feedback and may you continue to be curious and engaged.

Simplifying Measurement in Swift A quick and easy implementation  Jason Jobe Aug 1, 2021·2 min read  Image by William Warby from unsplash. I have always liked the idea of using explicit Measurement values (magnitude and unit) but I have generally found them cumbersome in actual code. There are a few solutions out there but I found them somehow unsatisfactory. So, after some research and reflection, I hit on the following as a desirable syntax that nicely supports autocomplete in Xcode from the available units for any typed Dimension.  And with a little thought and experimentation, I was able to implement this quite succinctly:  Add one small extension for an implicitly unitized zero value:  By using generics in the Double and Int extensions, we can easily include any other Measurement Units with no additional tedious boilerplate code to write.  If you find you want or need any additional units for a particular Dimensionthey are easy enough to add as extension:  If this is useful take a look here for the complete code along with some other useful additions. If you are interested in learning more about Units and Measurements and how to create your own custom ones I recommend the following.
