I have always liked the idea of using explicit `Measurement` values (magnitude and unit) but I have generally found them cumbersome in actual code.

There are a few solutions out there but I found them somehow unsatisfactory.

So, after some research and reflection, I hit on the following as a desirable syntax that nicely supports autocomplete in Xcode from the available units for any typed `Dimension`.

``` swift
let m: Mass = 123(.kilograms) // => 123.0 kg
let m2: Mass = 123(.kilograms) + 17(.stones) // => 230.95493 kg
m2.converted(to: .pounds) // 509.1688786398349 lb
```

And with a little thought and experimentation, I was able to implement this quite succinctly:

``` swift
public typealias Mass = Measurement<UnitMass>

public extension Double { 
func callAsFunction <U: Dimension>(_ units: U) -> Measurement<U> {
Measurement(value: self, unit: units)
}
}

public extension Int {
func callAsFunction <U: Dimension>(_ units: U) -> Measurement<U> {
Measurement(value: Double(self), unit: units)
}
}
```

Add one small extension for an implicitly unitized zero value:

``` swift
// Example
let z: Mass = .zero

// Using
public extension Measurement where UnitType: Dimension {
static var zero: Measurement<UnitType> {
Measurement(value: 0, unit: UnitType.baseUnit())
}
}
```

By using generics in the `Double` and `Int` extensions, we can easily include any other `Measurement` `Units` with no additional tedious boilerplate code to write.

``` swift
public typealias Duration = Measurement<UnitDuration>
public typealias Angle = Measurement<UnitAngle>
public typealias Length = Measurement<UnitLength>
public typealias Speed = Measurement<UnitSpeed>
```

If you find you want or need any additional units for a particular `Dimension`they are easy enough to add as extension:

``` swift
// As an example
extension UnitDuration {

static let SecondsPerDay: Double = 86_400

static let days = UnitDuration(symbol: "days", 
converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: SecondsPerDay))

static let weeks = UnitDuration(symbol: "weeks",
converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: SecondsPerDay * 7))

static let months = UnitDuration(symbol: "months",
converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: SecondsPerDay * 30))

static let years = UnitDuration(symbol: "years",
converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: SecondsPerDay * 365))
}
```
